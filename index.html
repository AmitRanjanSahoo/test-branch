        <p>
          In <b>GitHub</b>, everything stored like in your computer stores the files, inside a folder.
          Here, instead of folders, it has branches, each branch can have files and resourses of their own.
          Each branch is also part of a respiratory, means, that respiratory can have as many branches as it
          requires. <em>Tink as there is an industry(respiratory), and it has many factories(branches).</em>
        </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Create a new branch<hr></h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the <b>GitHub</b> site.</li>
              <li>Login to your profile.</li>
              <li>Go to the create button at the top right side of your display, you'll find a circular symbol to create new <b>respiratory</b>.<br>
              or <br> You can go to existing respiratory.</li>
              <li>You'll find a dropdown at leftside of display, just above the respiratory files. Click that.</li>
              <li>If not available create a new branch from there.</li>
              <li>Go to settings on the same line from where branch drop down was present.</li>
              <li>In the general settings you will find <q><b>Default branch</b></q>.</li>
              <li>There is arrow like button present, click that.</li>
              <li>There choose the branch you want to make default for that respiratory. Then click <b><q>Update</q></b>.</li>
              Now, you're done. That branch got selected as default!
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <aside>
          You can set rules for branches. Change the structure and many more. Main is set as default but it's not constant!
